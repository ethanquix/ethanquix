### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

French immigrant and software engineer who came to the US 4y ago.

I am working for an amazing startup who believed and support me since day 1.
I learned many things like scaling Go code for millions req/seconds and optimizing data pipelines.
I develop, scale and manage high-volume low-latency distributed services.

My latest achievement was a realtime data pipeline ingesting 6millions events/seconds and displaying multiple aggregate metrics to our customer with a 10ms latency.

On the side, I moved from SF to NYC and I am working during the evenings for a project to help New Yorker find the best events!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working during the day for a Ad Tech company and during the night on an app to help New Yorker navigate the endless stream of events
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Airflow / Spark / Mobile Dev
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on iOS dev
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Golang or Ad Tech!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
